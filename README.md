# Asset Variation Changer
This mod adds Invisible Roads, Custom Park Areas and Integrated Stops directly into the Game UI.

## Features

### Selectable Asset Variation
Use the arrow keys to cycle through the available variations of the selected asset. There is currently no UI for this feature, but it is planned for a future update.
Please note that not all assets have variations, and you have to move the asset to see the changes.

### Asset Variations stays after placing
After placing an asset the variation will stay the same, so it is easier to place multiple assets of the same variation in a row.


## Feature roadmap
- Visual Asset Selection
- Other UI
