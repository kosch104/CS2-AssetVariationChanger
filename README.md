# Asset Variation Changer
This mod allows you to control behavior of asset variations

## Features

### Selectable Asset Variation
Use the **arrow keys** (changeable) to cycle through the available variations of the selected asset. There is currently no UI for this feature, but it is planned for a future update.
Please note that not all assets have variations, and you have to move the asset to see the changes.

### Asset Variations stays after placing
After placing an asset the variation will stay the same, so it is easier to place multiple assets of the same variation in a row.


## Disclaimer
This mod is currently in an experimental state and there are known issue with Line Tool. When using the Lin~~~~e Tool the assets variations will all be the same, even when the randomize option is selected. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future update.


## Feature roadmap
- Compatibility with Line Tool
- Visual Asset Selection
- Other UI
